Data Exploration Portfolio Project Readme
Project Overview
This data exploration portfolio project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Covid-19 data using MySQL. The goal is to gain insights into the trends and patterns of the pandemic by leveraging a dataset related to Covid-19.
Project Structure
Data: This directory contains the Covid-19 dataset in a CSV format. Make sure to keep the dataset updated for the latest information.
Script: Contains SQL scripts used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Each script should be well-documented and organized based on the analysis steps.
Visualization: Save any visualization generated during the exploration process in this directory. Use charts, graphs, or any other visualization tools to convey insights effectively.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and insights obtained from the analysis.
Setup Instructions
1. Database Setup: Ensure you have a MySQL server installed. Create a new database for this project, and import the Covid-19 dataset.
 ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_password your_database < data/covid19_dataset.sql
    ```
2. Exploration Scripts: Run the SQL scripts in the `scripts/` directory in the specified order to perform data exploration and analysis.
    ```bash
    MySQL -u your_username -p your_password your_database < scripts/01_data_preparation.sql
    MySQL -u your_username -p your_password your_database < scripts/02_data_analysis.sql
    ```
3. Visualizations:  Execute any scripts in the `visualizations/` directory to generate visualizations based on the analysis.
